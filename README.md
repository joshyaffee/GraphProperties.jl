`GraphProperties.jl` is a Julia package that provides comprehensive tools for analyzing and manipulating graph properties. The package seamlessly integrates two key modules: `Invariants`, for computing various graph invariants, and `Communities`, for detecting and analyzing community structures within networks.

## Features

- **Invariants Module**: Compute crucial graph invariants like connectivity, girth, treewidth, and more, which are essential for understanding the underlying structure of graphs.

- **Communities Module**: Utilize state-of-the-art algorithms such as Louvain, K-Clique, Label Propagation, and PageRank to uncover community structures in large-scale networks.

- **Versatility**: Supports both unweighted and weighted graphs, along with a variety of graph input formats.

- **Performance**: Optimized for high performance with Julia's fast execution for both small-scale and large-scale graph analysis.

- **Visualization**: Tools for graph and community visualization are included to help illustrate the structure and properties of graphs.
